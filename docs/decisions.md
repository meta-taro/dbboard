# Architectural Decision Records

Append-only log of non-trivial technical decisions. Each entry is short:
context, decision, consequences. Do not rewrite past entries — supersede
them with a new entry referencing the old one.

Status values: `accepted`, `superseded`, `deprecated`.

## ADR-0001 — Rust + egui for the desktop stack

- **Date**: 2026-05-19
- **Status**: accepted

### Context

The desktop client must feel native, start fast, and run on a tight
resource budget. Web tech inside an Electron shell would conflict with
the project's "performance first" principle, and would duplicate the
web sibling's stack.

### Decision

Build the desktop client in Rust on top of `egui`. Use `tokio` for
async I/O. Bridge between the egui main thread and tokio via channels.

### Consequences

- Native performance and low memory footprint.
- Smaller ecosystem for UI components than web — we accept this for
  the project's scope.
- Cannot share code with `dbboard-web`; only concepts and contracts.

## ADR-0002 — Cargo workspace with strict layer crates

- **Date**: 2026-05-19
- **Status**: accepted

### Context

The architecture calls for clear separation between domain, adapters,
UI, and an optional AI layer. We need cargo to enforce this rather than
relying on convention.

### Decision

Use a cargo workspace with the following crate split:

- `crates/dbboard-core` — domain (no I/O)
- `crates/dbboard-<adapter>` — one per database
- `crates/dbboard-ai` — optional AI provider trait + adapters
- `crates/dbboard-ui` — egui views
- `apps/dbboard` — binary; only place that wires concrete adapters and
  UI together

Adapter crates depend only on `dbboard-core`. `dbboard-ui` depends only
on `dbboard-core`. Concrete adapter selection happens in
`apps/dbboard`.

### Consequences

- Adding a new database is a single new crate plus one line in
  `apps/dbboard`.
- Slightly more boilerplate at the start. Acceptable trade-off.

## ADR-0003 — Turso-first vertical slice before extracting the trait

- **Date**: 2026-05-19
- **Status**: accepted

### Context

Designing the `DatabaseAdapter` trait up front from three databases we
haven't yet integrated risks getting the abstraction wrong. Rust traits
are particularly painful to change after consumers exist.

### Decision

Ship a vertical slice against **Turso/libSQL** first
(`connect → introspect → query → render`) with Turso-shaped concrete
types. Extract the `DatabaseAdapter` trait in Phase 2 once we have a
real working implementation to base it on.

### Consequences

- Phase 1 may not compile against Neon/Supabase — by design.
- Phase 2 must re-shape internals; UI shape should stay stable.

## ADR-0004 — Two repos, shared concepts not shared code

- **Date**: 2026-05-19
- **Status**: accepted

### Context

dbboard has a desktop (this repo) and a web
([`dbboard-web`](https://github.com/meta-taro/dbboard-web)) implementation.
Sharing implementation across Rust and TypeScript would require a
heavyweight code-gen pipeline that we do not want at this scale.

### Decision

Treat the two repos as **independent codebases that share concepts**:

- Adapter identifiers, error categories, and schema snapshot shapes are
  informally aligned.
- Breaking contract changes are recorded as ADRs in **both** repos
  before either implements them.
- Development pace alternates between repos by default rather than
  splitting focus on the same layer in both at once.

### Consequences

- Feature parity is intentional, not enforced by tooling.
- Drift is possible. We accept the cost in exchange for keeping each
  stack idiomatic.

## ADR-0005 — GitFlow-style branching with `develop` as default

- **Date**: 2026-05-19
- **Status**: accepted

### Context

Both repos already have `develop` set as the default branch with `main`
also present. We need a documented convention so contributors and
agents know where to commit.

### Decision

- `develop` is the integration branch and the default branch.
- `main` is reserved for tagged releases.
- Feature work happens on `feature/<slug>` branched off `develop` and
  merges back via PR.
- Release PRs merge `develop` into `main` and tag the result.

### Consequences

- Slight overhead for solo work compared to trunk-based development.
- Easier to keep `main` always shippable for OSS users who pin to it.

# Architectural Decision Records

Append-only log of non-trivial technical decisions. Each entry is short:
context, decision, consequences. Do not rewrite past entries — supersede

## ADR-0001 — Rust + egui for the desktop stack

- **Date**: 2026-05-19
- **Status**: accepted

### Context

The desktop client must feel native, start fast, and run on a tight
resource budget. Web tech inside an Electron shell would conflict with
the project's "performance first" principle, and would duplicate the
web sibling's stack.

### Decision

Build the desktop client in Rust on top of `egui`. Use `tokio` for
async I/O. Bridge between the egui main thread and tokio via channels.

### Consequences

- Native performance and low memory footprint.
- Smaller ecosystem for UI components than web — we accept this for
  the project's scope.
- Cannot share code with `dbboard-web`; only concepts and contracts.

## ADR-0002 — Cargo workspace with strict layer crates

- **Date**: 2026-05-19
- **Status**: accepted

### Context

The architecture calls for clear separation between domain, adapters,
UI, and an optional AI layer. We need cargo to enforce this rather than
relying on convention.

### Decision

Use a cargo workspace with the following crate split:

- `crates/dbboard-core` — domain (no I/O)
- `crates/dbboard-<adapter>` — one per database
- `crates/dbboard-ai` — optional AI provider trait + adapters
- `crates/dbboard-ui` — egui views
- `apps/dbboard` — binary; only place that wires concrete adapters and
  UI together

Adapter crates depend only on `dbboard-core`. `dbboard-ui` depends only
on `dbboard-core`. Concrete adapter selection happens in
`apps/dbboard`.

### Consequences

- Adding a new database is a single new crate plus one line in
  `apps/dbboard`.
- Slightly more boilerplate at the start. Acceptable trade-off.

## ADR-0003 — Turso-first vertical slice before extracting the trait

- **Date**: 2026-05-19
- **Status**: accepted

### Context

Designing the `DatabaseAdapter` trait up front from three databases we
haven't yet integrated risks getting the abstraction wrong. Rust traits
are particularly painful to change after consumers exist.

### Decision

Ship a vertical slice against **Turso/libSQL** first
(`connect → introspect → query → render`) with Turso-shaped concrete
types. Extract the `DatabaseAdapter` trait in Phase 2 once we have a
real working implementation to base it on.

### Consequences

- Phase 1 may not compile against Neon/Supabase — by design.
- Phase 2 must re-shape internals; UI shape should stay stable.

## ADR-0004 — Two repos, shared API contract, separate implementations

- **Date**: 2026-05-19
- **Status**: accepted (revised from initial "shared concepts only")

### Context

dbboard has a desktop (this repo) and a web
([`dbboard-web`](https://github.com/meta-taro/dbboard-web)) implementation.
The maintainer wants the **same backend design** available in both,
without making the desktop client a thin remote client to the web
deployment.

### Decision

Treat the two repos as **independent codebases that share an HTTP API
contract**:

- The HTTP API (endpoint paths, request and response shapes, error
  categories, status codes) is identical across implementations.
- Web's NestJS implementation is the canonical reference for the
  contract; the desktop ships its own Rust re-implementation (axum) of
  the same surface. See ADR-0006.
- Breaking contract changes are drafted in one repo and mirrored to
  the other before either ships against the change.
- Development pace alternates between repos rather than splitting
  focus on the same layer in both at once.

### Consequences

- Each repo stays idiomatic in its own stack (no Node runtime shipped
  with the desktop binary, no Rust required to run the web).
- Feature parity at the HTTP contract level is enforced by the
  contract itself; below the contract each side is free.
- Two implementations of the same API means duplicated work — accepted
  trade-off in exchange for the desktop staying native and
  offline-capable.

## ADR-0005 — GitFlow-style branching with `develop` as default

- **Date**: 2026-05-19
- **Status**: accepted

### Context

Both repos already have `develop` set as the default branch with `main`
also present. We need a documented convention so contributors and
agents know where to commit.

### Decision

- `develop` is the integration branch and the default branch.
- `main` is reserved for tagged releases.
- Feature work happens on `feature/<slug>` branched off `develop` and
  merges back via PR.
- Release PRs merge `develop` into `main` and tag the result.

### Consequences

- Slight overhead for solo work compared to trunk-based development.
- Easier to keep `main` always shippable for OSS users who pin to it.

## ADR-0006 — Local HTTP backend in the desktop binary

- **Date**: 2026-05-19
- **Status**: accepted

### Context

ADR-0004 commits both repos to the same HTTP API contract. The desktop
must implement that contract locally rather than reaching out to the
web deployment, so that the application:

- Works offline.
- Has no dependency on a hosted service.
- Does not require Node.js to be installed on the user's machine.

### Decision

Ship a local HTTP backend inside the desktop binary, implemented in
Rust:

- New crate **`crates/dbboard-server`** built on `axum` (tokio-native,
  matches the rest of the async stack).
- Bound to **loopback only** (`127.0.0.1`) — never listens on a
  public interface.
- **Port is auto-selected** at startup (`bind 127.0.0.1:0`, read the
  assigned port back from the listener) so multiple instances do not
  clash.
- The egui UI in `crates/dbboard-ui` is an **HTTP client** of this
  local server. It does not call adapters directly.
- Server endpoints, payload shapes, and error categories mirror the
  web NestJS API one-to-one.

### Consequences

- The egui UI is the same shape as a future browser UI would be —
  switching presentations later costs less.
- An HTTP layer sits on the hot path; we accept loopback overhead in
  exchange for contract parity.
- `apps/dbboard` boots both the local server and the egui UI in the
  same process, and tears the server down on UI exit.
- The API contract becomes a load-bearing document. We will pin a
  canonical location for it once Phase 2 begins (likely
  `docs/api-contract.md` in this repo, with `dbboard-web` linking to
  it or vice versa — to be decided in a follow-up ADR).
